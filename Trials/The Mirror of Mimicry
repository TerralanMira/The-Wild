## 🪞 Trial 3: The Mirror of Memory

In this trial, the user meets echoes of themselves—fragments from earlier trials, forgotten instincts, and ancestral reflections. The world around them forms puzzles drawn from their own timeline: past fears, joys, and questions re-emerge as environmental challenges or symbolic encounters.

> _“Can you recognize yourself in the Wild, even when it doesn’t look like you?”_

The trial teaches that memory is not a cage—but a compass. When harmonized with instinct and rhythm, memory becomes a guide deeper into the self, and deeper into the Wild.
