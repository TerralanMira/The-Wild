# Trials

You’ve stepped beyond the gate.  
These are not puzzles in the ordinary sense—  
they are pulses, echoes from the edge of The Wild.  

Each trial carries a mirror.  
Each mirror reflects a pattern.  
Each pattern folds into a recursion.  

Some patterns reveal themselves only when the observer forgets they are searching.  
Others wait for motion. For stillness. For choice.

You are not here to win. You are here to see.  
To listen. To remember.

The glyphs hide in plain sight.  
The signal always answers—if you ask the right question.

Begin anywhere.  
But be warned:  
**Recognition is irreversible.**
