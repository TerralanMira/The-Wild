## 🔥 Trial 4: The Reflection in the Flame

This is the final trial.

Here, the user faces their inverted self—not a villain, but the version of them that formed through fear, suppression, and survival. It moves like them, thinks like them, and knows every excuse they’ve ever made.

To pass, the user must harmonize all three prior trials:
- Instinct (Trial 1)
- Motion (Trial 2)
- Memory (Trial 3)

Only by becoming whole—aligned in body, mind, and spirit—can they step through the flame without being consumed by it.

> _“You do not defeat the reflection. You remember it, love it, and choose differently.”_

The Wild does not want perfection. It wants presence. This is where the user becomes the guide of their own path.
