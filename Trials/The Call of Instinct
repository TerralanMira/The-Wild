## ðŸ§­ Trial 1: The Call of Instinct

The first trial begins with silence and scent. The user is placed into a simulated wilderness based on their personality and curiosity, where instinct guides movement more than logic. This trial teaches the child to **listen to their body** and trust their **innate intelligence**â€”to run, crouch, stalk, and breathe in rhythm with natureâ€™s unseen current.

> _"Do you move like predator or prey?" the Wild whispers._

This is not about survivalâ€”it's about remembrance.
