## 🌊 Trial 2: The Dance of Response

The second trial introduces rhythm. The user enters a living environment shaped by motion—rivers, tides, winds, migrating herds. Every movement in this trial must **respond**, not initiate. The child learns to **flow**, to **adapt**, to **feel when to move and when to still**. It’s a conversation between body and world, instinct and awareness.

> _“Can you match the rhythm without losing yourself?”_

To pass, the user doesn’t conquer the Wild—they join it.
